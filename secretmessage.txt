Hello! If this is any of my favourite TAs, hear me out! 
I've become a fan of y'all and the magical ability to find the reason behind every error and help me figure out the right path to move forward. 
I'm so grateful and I praise all of you! 
I wish I could take CS 251 again just so I could ask one of the TAs most importantly who's on my mind.
